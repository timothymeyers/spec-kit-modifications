# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[####-feature-name]/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[ID]**: Task identifier `T-####-NNN` where `####` is the 4-digit spec number (aligned to the GitHub issue) and `NNN` is a 3-digit sequence (e.g. `T-0042-001`)
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to, using the story identifier (e.g., `US-0042-01`, `US-0042-02`)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit-tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T-####-001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T-####-002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T-####-003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T-####-004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T-####-005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T-####-006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T-####-007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T-####-008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T-####-009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) `US-####-01` 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T-####-010 [P] [US-####-01] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T-####-011 [P] [US-####-01] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T-####-012 [P] [US-####-01] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T-####-013 [P] [US-####-01] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T-####-014 [US-####-01] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T-####-012, T-####-013)
- [ ] T-####-015 [US-####-01] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T-####-016 [US-####-01] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T-####-017 [US-####-01] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2) `US-####-02`

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T-####-018 [P] [US-####-02] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T-####-019 [P] [US-####-02] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T-####-020 [P] [US-####-02] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T-####-021 [US-####-02] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T-####-022 [US-####-02] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T-####-023 [US-####-02] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3) `US-####-03`

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T-####-024 [P] [US-####-03] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T-####-025 [P] [US-####-03] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T-####-026 [P] [US-####-03] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T-####-027 [US-####-03] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T-####-028 [US-####-03] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T-####-XXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] T-####-XXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T-####-XXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T-####-XXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] T-####-XXX Security hardening
- [ ] T-####-XXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)** `US-####-01`: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)** `US-####-02`: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US-####-01 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)** `US-####-03`: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US-####-01/US-####-02 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
